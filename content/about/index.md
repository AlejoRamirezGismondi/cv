Experienced Software Engineer. Currently looking for work in Europe, especially roles related to Game Design and Development, Web3, Crypto or I+D+i.

I have a particular interest for Game Design and Game Development, and have focused my final theses from university on that subject, developing a videogame in the Unity Engine. In my free time I like playing games with my friends. We have a Dungeons and Dragons group that gets together once a week to enjoy some epic storytelling and dice rolling.

With a passion for what I do and a dedication to delivering high-quality solutions, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or explore new possibilities.

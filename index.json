I centered mine around the concept of Game Development, investigating and presenting a 200 page paper on the subject. Complementary to this, I put the researched knowledge into practice by actually developing my own simple videogame in the Unity Engine.\nThis game features different mechanics inspired in other similar RPGs, farm-simulator games and other puzzle games. The pixel art presented in the game is either from open source, royalty-free sources or created by myself in Aseprite.\nThe project took about six months to be completed, between Art, Coding and Game Design. This was my first videogame ever created so I had to learn how to do things fron scratch and iterate over them as I discovered new and better solutions. I also borrowed the help of friends and family to carry out playtests and refine features.\nYou can find both the original paper and the presentation in the following links.
